# Twitter datasets

Twitter's Terms of Service restricts the distribution of tweet contents. To ensure research reproducibility, we publish our datasets in a manner similar to the [TREC Microblog Track](http://trec.nist.gov/data/microblog.html) in which a list of tweet IDs was released instead. Through this list, tweet content can be crawled from the [Twitter public API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/show/%3Aid).

# Technical facilities

The facilities to retrieve tweet contents from their ids is not provided by the authors. However, we recommend to use existing tools from the [social sensor project](https://github.com/socialsensor/twitter-dataset-collector).
