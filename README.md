# Twitter datasets

Twitter's Terms of Service restricts the distribution of tweet contents. To ensure research reproducibility, we publish our datasets in a manner similar to the [TREC Microblog Track](http://trec.nist.gov/data/microblog.html) in which a list of tweet IDs is released instead. Through this list, tweet content can be crawled from the [Twitter public API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/show/%3Aid) through the statuses/show/:id endpoint.

# Technical facilities

Tools to automatically retrieve tweet contents from their ids are not provided by the authors, but some have been developed within the [social sensor project](https://github.com/socialsensor/twitter-dataset-collector).

Note that some tweets might have been deleted or their users changed the privacy level.
