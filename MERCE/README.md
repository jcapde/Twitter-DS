# "La Mercè" dataset

This dataset contains tweet_ids for all tweets geo-located in the city of Barcelona during its local festivities in 2014 and 2015 (“2014/tweets.txt 2015/tweets.txt”). We also provide the subset of tweets that are labeled with the corresponding event (“2014/labeled_events.csv”, “2015/labeled_events.csv”).
